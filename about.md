# About Me

Hi, I'm Mikolai — a backend developer passionate about Scala, Java, and the JVM ecosystem.

I studied Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Belarusian State University, where I developed a strong foundation in computer science and system design. The experience shaped my engineering mindset and taught me how to solve complex business problems effectively.

Currently, I work at T-Bank, focusing on the performance and reliability of authentication and authorization services used by millions daily. I use the ZIO ecosystem to build scalable, resilient systems and help migrate legacy services from Akka + Future to Scala 3 and ZIO.

One of my key contributions was implementing a JVM warm-up strategy that enables zero-downtime daytime releases — a major step forward for our deployment process.

I have a deep interest in JVM internals and performance tuning. My diploma thesis explored techniques for accelerating JVM startup, and I continue to apply those insights in production systems.

Outside of work, I enjoy writing functional code and experimenting with languages like OCaml and Go — especially in the context of concurrent systems and lightweight services.

I'm excited to grow further in functional programming, distributed systems, and backend development — especially within innovative, forward-thinking teams.

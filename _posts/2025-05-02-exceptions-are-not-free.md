🚨 Did you know that creating exceptions can quietly hurt your performance?

Many people use exceptions as a control flow tool, and it helps to:

• Keep the happy path clean and in place
• Move error handling to where it fits better
• Reduce code verbosity
• Make the code look cleaner and more readable
  

But exceptions are not free in terms of memory and performance.

To create an exception, the JVM needs to generate a stack trace — and this is far from free. Both CPU cost and memory usage grow with the depth of the call stack.

I write in Scala, and there's a common pattern to mark control-flow exceptions with NoStackTrace — a trait for exceptions which, for efficiency reasons, do not fill in the stack trace.

📚 Scala doc: https://www.scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/util/control/NoStackTrace.html
  

This is primarily a JVM-related topic, but I believe any language where exceptions capture stack traces will face similar issues.

💭 Does your memory profiler show exceptions hogging space? Here’s why.
